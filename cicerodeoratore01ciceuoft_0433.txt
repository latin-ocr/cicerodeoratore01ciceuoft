DE ORATORE„ ΙΙ. lxvi. 266—268

hung below the New Shops,⁰ with the body twisted,
the tongue protruding and the cheeks baggy ι this
raised laughter, for nothing so like Mancia was ever
seen. Another instance was my telling Titus
Pinarius, who kept twisting his chin when he was
speaking, that the time for his observations, if he
wished to say anything, would come when he had
finished cracking his nut.

267 ‘⁸ Then again there are those intentional understate- under-'-
ments or overstatements which are exaggerated to ⁸⁵⁸⁸⁰¹²¹⁰¹¹⁸³
a degree of the astonishing that passes belief, such
as your own assertion, Crassus, made in a speech
before a public assembly, that Memmius thought
himself so exalted an individual that, on his way
down into the Market Place, he lowered his head in
order to pass under the Arch of Fabius.⁶ To this
category also belongs the taunt said to have been
uttered by Scipio at Numantia, when he was in a rage
with Gaius Metellus, that ‘ if the mother of Metellus
should bear a fifth time, she would be found to have
borne an ass.' ⁶

268 ‘⁴ And a elever hint may be dropped when some hard
and unintelligible saying is illuminated by some small
detail, often by a word, as when Publius Cornelius,
regarded as a covetous and dishonest man, but con-
spicuously brave and a competent military com-
mander, thanked Gaius Fabricius ά for having (though
no friend of his) procured his election as consul, and
that too in the course of an important and trouble-
some war. ‘ No need to thank me,’ replied the
other, ‘ for choosing to be plundered rather than sold
into bondage.' ⁶ Compare with this the retort of

general, who would probably lead his followers to defeat,
capture and the ancient fate of prisoners of war.
