nature of an art, a statute or a community, in which
circumstances scientific method ordains that the
significance of whatever you are defining shall be

109 made plain, with no omission or redundance. But in
that case of ours Sulpicius did no such thing nor did
I attempt it, since we both, to the utmost of our
power, enlarged with all our fluency upon the mean-
ing of ‘ act of treason.’ For, in the first place, if the
addition or substraction of a word be seized on, a
definitionis often wrung from our grasp, and then too
the very suggestion savours of the schools and a
training little better than elementary, and lastly the
definition cannot reach the understanding and reason
of the arbitrator, as it slips by him before he has
taken it in.

certainty arises from passages which contradict one
another, there emerges no new sort of problem, but
a double example of the former kind. And this
will either prove insoluble, or will be so solved, that
by the restoration of the words omitted, whichever
version we are upholding will be completed. It
follows that only one class is left of problems turn-
ing on the writer’s language, these arising where
something has been equivocally expressed.
