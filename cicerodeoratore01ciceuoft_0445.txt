DE ORATORE, ΙΙ. lxix. 280—lxx. 284

these interpretations of the initials were wrong.
‘What do they mean then ? ’ said Scaurus. ‘ Aemilius
filched. Punish Rutilius!

281 LXX. ‘⁶ A laugh is also scored by sentences that do unexpeoted
not hang together t ‘ What does this gentleman lack turns,
—except cash and character? ' Another pretty turn
is a friendly criticism of an implied mistake‚ as when
Granius reproved Albius because, when Albucius was
held to have proved a statement on the evidence
of Albius’s accounts, Albius was not only much de-
lighted by Scaevola’s acquittal but actually failed to
see that a verdict had been given against his own

have a drink of chilled wine and honey as soon as he
got home, he answered ‘ If I do that, I shall ruin my

out what goes with anybody’s individual character-
istics ; as for instance, when Scaurus was somewhat
under a cloud for having taken possession of the
estate of a wealthy person named Pompeius Phrygio
who had died intestate, and was appearing in court
as an assessor on behalf of a defendant named Bestia,
a funeral happened to pass by, and Gaius Memmius
who was for the prosecution said, ‘ Look, Scaurus,
there's a dead man being bundled out of the way—if

284 only you can get possession.' But of all these devices
nothing causes more amusement than an unexpected
turn, of which there are countless instances-for
example, the remark of old Appius senior,‘² who
