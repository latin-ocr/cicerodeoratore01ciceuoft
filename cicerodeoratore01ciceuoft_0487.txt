there are a number of different ways of falling foul
of the public, one must be careful not to arouse the

to show some fault of character, or by personal
annoyance or dislike that is either deserved or arises
from slander and rumour, or if the subject is un-
popular, or if the public is in a state of excitement
arising out of some desire or alarm that it feels.
These four causes of unpopularity can be met by
as many remedies: sometimes by reproof, if one
possesses authority, sometimes by admonition, which
may be called a gentle form of reproof, sometimes
by promising that if they will hear us out they will
agree with us, and sometime, by apology, which is
not a strong line to take, but is sometimes useful.

way 3 for nothing is so easy as to divert a crowd from
gloominess and often from bitter feeling by means of
a neat and terse and pointed and amusing phrase.
