DE ORATORE, Ι. lv. 236—lvi. 238

up two glorious arts, on an equality with each other,
and partners in one grandeur. But as it is you
admit that a man may be learned in the law without
possessing this eloquence which we are investigating,
and that many such have appeared ; while you deny
the possibility of the existence of an orator who has
not acquired that legal knowledge as well. So by
your account the learned lawyer, in and by himself,
is nothing but a circumspect and sharp kind of petti-
fogger, a crier of legal actions, a chanter of legal
formulas, a trapper of syllables3 but, because the
orator in Court often employs the aid of the law, you
have therefore associated your legal knowledge with
Eloquence, as a little maid to follow at her heels.
237 LVI. “ But as for your wondering at the shameless- Indead often
ness of those counsel who either made great pro- ζξζέξξζίξ,
fessions, though ignorant of small details, or dared
to handle in Court the highest topics of common law,
though they knew nothing about them, and had
never studied them, there is a simple and obvious
excuse in each case. For there is nothing marvellous
in a man, who is ignorant of the formalities of
marriage by purchase, being none the less able to
conduct the case of a woman married in that manner ;
nor, because the same kind of skill is exercised in
steering a little craft as a large vessel, does it
follow that he, who does not know the technical
phrases required for the division of an inheritance,
cannot conduct a suit for the partition of an estate.
238 Why ἔ to take your own citations of most important
proceedings before the Hundred Commissioners‚
which turned upon questions of law, which of those
cases, pray, could not have been most handsomely
argued by a man of eloquence unversed in law?
