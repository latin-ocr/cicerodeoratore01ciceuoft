DE ORATORE, Ι. xl. 181-183

cluding an unpopular treaty with their nation, and
whose surrender they had refused to accept, where-
upon he returned home and unhesitatingly came
into the Senate-house : Publius Rutilius, son of
Marcus and tribune of the commons, ordered him
to be removed, affirming that he was no citizen,
in view of the traditional rule that a man sold by
his father or by the people, or delivered up by the
Priestly Envoy, had no right of restoration.⁰
‘⁴ What judicial controversy can we discover, with-
182 in the whole range of public life, more important
than one touching the rank, state-membership, free-
dom and entire civil rights of a past consul, especially
as this issue did not depend upon some accusation of
fact, which the defendant might be able to disprove,
but upon a point of common law? And in a simi-
lar case, affecting humbler folk, if a member of an
allied people, after being a slave in Rome, had ac-
quired his freedom and subsequently returned home;
it was a moot point with our forefathers whether by
process of restoration he had not reverted to his
former nationality and lost his Roman citizenship.
183 Then as to freedom, the most serious issue there
can be, may not controversy arise out of the
common law, on the question whether a slave, en-
rolled with his master's consent on the censor’s list,
is to date his enfranchisement from that moment,
or from completion of the lustrum ? ⁶ And what of
a case that really happened, within our fathers’
recollection, of the head of a family coming from
Spain to Rome, and leaving in the province his wife
with child: at Rome he married another wife,

cluded the proceedings of the census and brought the new re·
gister of citizens into operation for the ensuing five yearS.
