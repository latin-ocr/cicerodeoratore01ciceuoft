DE ORATORE, Ι. xv. 64-67

someone considers my expression ‘ whatever the
topic ' to be altogether too extensive, he may clip
and prune it to his individual taste, but to this much
I shall hold fast—though the orator be ignorant of
what is to be found in all the other arts and branches
of study, and know only what is dealt with in debate
and the practice of public-speaking ; none the less,
if he should have to discourse even on these other
subj ects, then after learning the technicalities of each
from those who know the same, the orator will speak
about them far better than even the men who are
66 masters of these artS. For example, should our
friend Sulpicius here have to speak upon the art of
war, he will inquire of our relative Gaius Marius, and
when he has received his teachings, will deliver him-

to be almost better informed on the subject than
Gaius Marius himself 3 while if his topic is to be the
law of private rights, he will consult yourself and,
notwithstanding your consummate learning and
skill in these very things which you have taught him,
67 he will surpass you in the art of exposition. If again
some matter should confront him wherein he must
speak of human nature, human vices or the passions,
of moderation or sels-control, of sorrow or death, then
perhaps if he thinks fit———although an orator must have
knowledge of such things—he will have taken counsel
with Sextus Pompeius, a man accomplished in moral
science 3 so much he will assuredly achieve‚ that
