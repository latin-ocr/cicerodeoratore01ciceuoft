and delivery 3 (6) the division of a speech into the
proper parts; (¹7) rules of diction. Such a system
though useful has not in fact been the guide of the
ablest orators. Praetice 1s all· -important; it includes
(§§ 148- -159) speaking on cases taken from real
life, occasionally impromptu3 writing compositions,
for training both in style and in matter; making
paraphrases of poetry, especially Greek poetry, and
prose, from memory3 training voice and gesture;
memoria technica ; speaking in public ; critical reading
of literature3 debating pro and contra3 study of
history, law and politics; collecting notes. Wide
knowledge is essential. The true orator possesses
dignity and force (160-204).

(§§ 205-209) Sulpicius asks for further detail, and
Antonius consents to give his own views. (ἓὲ 209-218)
He challenges Crassus’s definition z an orator must
be able to speak agreeably and convincingly on public
questions, but does not require wide general culture:
that is a matter belonging to some other art. (§§ 219-
233) Ιιι order to work on the emotions he needs
shrewdness‚ experience and knowledge of the world,
but not philosophy—some effective lines of pleading
might be disapproved of by philosophers. (§§ 234-
239) Wide knowledge of law is also unnecessary : it
is eloquence that wins cases, and on hard points of
law even the experts disagree. (§§ 240-250) Nor is
law an easy or attractive study. A general acquaint-
ance with its principles is all that a busy man can or
need attain 3 details should be got up for the occasion.
(ἓὲ 251- —262) Similarly voice· control, history, antiquities
must be studied to some extent, but not so far as to
encroach on the time needed for practice in speaking
—practice is the important thing.
