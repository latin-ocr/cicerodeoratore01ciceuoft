THE MAKING OF AN ORATOR ἢ
BOOK THE SECOND (⁸245

1 Ι. Wmm we were boys, brother Quintus, there was, Introduc-
if you remember, a widespread belief that Lucius ξίζξῃζξὶξξ
Crassus had dabbled no further in learning than the cmsup and
early training of a lad of his day allowed, and that ffifflfflff
Marcus Antonius was absolutely without any educa· emffln·
tion and ignorant. And there were many who, while
they did not hold this to be the truth of the matter,
none the less hoped the more readily to deter us
eager students in search of eloquence from the F(

pursuit of learning, and so they did not scruple to J(
make such statements about those eminent orators3 , ζ
to the intent that we ourselves, on seeing that men ²
who were no scholars had attained the highest degree ⁵ ⁴ ²
of practieal wisdom, and a standard of eloquence ²¹, ι
passing belief, might come to look upon all our own ⁵23>
labour as being but in vain, and to think mere folly ²432
the care bestowed upon our edueation by a man so
excellent and widely experienced as our father.

2 Such sophists we used at that time to eonfound, in
boyish fashion, by calling witnesses from home,
namely our father, our near kinsman Gaius Aculeo,
and our paternal uncle Lucius Cicero, inasmueh as
our father, and Aculeo, who married our mother’s

sister, and was esteemed by Crassus above all other
