DE ORATORE, I. xxxi. 140-143

140 further that contentions also arise out of the con-
struction of a document, wherein there is some
ambiguity or contradiction, or something is so
expressed that the written word is at variance with
the intention; and again that to all these kinds
certain modes of proof are assigned as appropriate.

141 Again I heard that, of such questions as are distinet
from general issues, some have their place in courts
of justice, others in deliberations3 while there was
yet a third kind, which had to do with the extolling
or reviling of particular persons ; and that there were
prescribed commonplaces ⁰ which we were to employ
in the law-courts where equity was our aim 3 others
for use in deliberations, all of which were arranged
for the benefit of those to whom we might be giving
counsel ; and others again in panegyric, wherein
the sole consideration was the greatness of the

142 individuals concerned. And, since all the activity
and ability of an orator falls into five divisions, I
learned that he must first hit upon what to say3
then manage and marshal his discoveries, not merely
in orderly fashion, but with a discriminating eye for
the exact weight as it were of each argument; next
go on to array them in the adornments of style ; after
that keep them guarded in his memory ; and in the

143 end deliver them with effect and charm: I had also
been taught that, before speaking on the issue, we
must first secure the goodwill of our audience; that
next we must state our case ; afterwards define the
dispute3 then establish our own allegations3 sub-
sequently disprove those. of the other side; and in
our peroration expand and reinforce all that was
in our favour, while we weakened and demolished
whatever went to support our opponents.
