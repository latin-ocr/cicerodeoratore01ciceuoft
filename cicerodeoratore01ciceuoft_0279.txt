DE ORATORE, ῙΙ. xv. 65—xvi. 67

there lies a boundless forest of topics: because (as
Crassus too has shown) most writers have assigned
to the orator two kinds of subject to talk upon, the
one concerned with what is specific and determinate,
such as the matters handled in lawsuits and consulta-
tions,-to which he who will may add panegyrics—;
the other spoken of by nearly every writer,—though
explained by none—‚ as the abstraet sort of inquiry,

66 unrelated to times or persons. When discussing this
kind they do not seem to me to grasp its nature and
range. For if it be an orator's part to be able to
speak on any subject whatever that is laid before him
in general terms, he will have to discuss the size of the
sun and the contour of the earth ; and after under-
taking this duty he will not be able to refuse to
handle mathematics or the cult of the Muses. In a
word, for the man who claims the right to speak‚ not
only on problems identified with speeific times and
persons (that is, on all judicial issues), but also on
propositions of an abstract character, there can be no
sort of debate which he can decline.

67 XVI. ‘⁴ But if we would connect with the orator Treatmenu
that indeterminate, unrestricted and far—extending {³32}ssaean
sort of investigation‚ and so think it his duty to discuss taet-
good and evil, things to be preferred and things to
be shunned, fair repute and infamy, the useful and
the unusefuL besides moral perfection, righteous-
ness, sels-control, discretion, greatness of soul,
generosity, loyalty, friendsffip, good saith, sense of
duty and the rest of the virtues and their corre-
sponding vices, as well as the State, sovereignty‚
war-like operations, political science and the ways of
mankind—then let us take up that kind of inquiry
also, but only on condition that it be confined within
