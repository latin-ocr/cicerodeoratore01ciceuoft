reckoned as belonging peculiarly to the rest of the ‘⁰‘ “5¹⁰2
artS, do indeed pertain to the knowledge of their
professors‚ yet if anyone should wish by speaking to

put these same arts in their full light, it is to oratorical

62 skill that he must run for help. If, again, it is estab-
lished that Philo, that master-builder who constructed
an arsenal for the Athenians, described the plan of
his work very eloquently to the people, his eloquence
must be ascribed not to his architectural, but rather
to his oratorical ability. So too, if Marcus Antonius
here had had to speak on behalf of Hermodorus upon
the construction of dockyardS, having got up his case
from his client, he would then have discoursed grace-
fully and copiously of an art to which he was not a
stranger. Asclepiades also, he with whom we have
been familiar both as physician and as friend, at the
time when he was surpassing the rest of his profession
in eloquence, was exhibiting, in such graceful speak-

63 ing, the skill of an orator, not that of a physician. In
fact that favourite assertion of Socrates—that every
man was eloquent enough upon a subject that he
knew—has in it some plausibility but no truth ι it
is nearer the truth to say that neither can anyone be
eloquent upon a subject that is unknown to him, nor,
if he knows it perfectly and yet does not know how
to shape and polish his style, can he speak fluently
even upon that which he does know.

a comprehensive manner the complete and special ggghffip up
meaning of the word, he will be an orator, in my cantius, but
opinion worthy of so dignified a title, who, whatever ¹¹⁶ must ¹³⁰
