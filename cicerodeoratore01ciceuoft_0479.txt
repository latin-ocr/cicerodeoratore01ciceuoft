DE ORATORE, ΙΙ. lxxx. 327—lxxxi. 330

he could have completed the whole affair in a matter
of ten verses ! although the actual phrase ‘ The
funeral—we start,' though very concise, neverthe-
less achieves not brevity but rather grace of style.
328 Supposing it had merely run ⁸ She was placed on the
pyre,' the whole of the facts could have been easily
understood nevertheless ς but the narrative gains
liveliness when it brings in several characters and is
broken up with speeches‚ and also one’s statement
of what took place is both more convincing when one
explains how it was done and much clearer to under-
stand if occasionally a halt is called and the story
329 does not run right on with that curt brevity. The
narrative ought to be as clear as all the other parts of
the speech, but more pains must be taken to achieve
clarity in this part because in narrating the facts of
the case it is more difficult to avoid obscurity than in
either the introduction or the proof or the peroration,
and also obscurity is even more dangerous in this part
of a speech than in the others, either because an ob-
scure expression in any other place only causes the
point obscurely expressed to be lost, but obscurity in
the narrative blacks out the entire speech, or else
because,whereas with other points if you have ex-
pressed them rather obscurely at one time you can
express them more clearly in another place, there is
only one place in a case for the narration. But clear-
ness in the narration will be attained if it employs
ordinary language, and if it keeps to the chrono-
logical order of events and is not broken by digres-

use narrative is a matter for consideration: narra-
