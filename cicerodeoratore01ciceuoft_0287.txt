DE ORATORE, ΙΙ. xviii. 74-76

the less I am asking for these secrets of yours, not for
my own use but prompted solely by love of knowledge.

75 Nor do Ι need any Greek professor to chant at me
a series of hackneyed axioms, when he himself never
had a glimpse of a law-court or judicial proceefflng,
as the tale goes of Phormio the well-known Peri-
patetic3 for when Hannibal, banished from Carthage,
had come in exile to Antiochus at Ephesus and, inas-
much as his name was highly honoured all the world
over, had been invited by his hosts to hear the
philosopher in question, if he so pleased, and he had
intimated his willingness to do so, that wordy in-
dividual is said to have held forth for several hours
upon the functions of a commander-in-chief and
military matters in general. Then‚ when the other
listeners, vastly delighted, asked Hannibal for his
opinion of the eminent teacher, the Carthaginian is
reported to have thereupon replied, in no very good
Greek, but at any rate candidly, that time and again
he had seen many old madmen but never one madder

76 than Phormio. And upon my word he was right, for
what better example of prating insolence could there
be than for a Greek, who had never seen a foeman or
a camp, or even had the slightest connexion with any
public employment, to lecture on military matters to
Hannibal, who all those years had been disputing
empire with the Roman people, the conquerors of the
world ? Just so do all those seem to me to behave
who lay down ἕψῃ, for they
are for teaching others a t ng wi which they
themselves are unacquainted. But possibly their
blunder is the less serious, in that they do not try to
instruct yourself, as Phormio did Hannibal, but only
boys or very young men-'⁸
