DE ORATORE, ΙΙ. ii. ⁷-9

they once had on the subject, my purpose being, in
the first place, to dispel that notion, which had
always prevailed, that one of them had no great
learning and the other none at all; secondly, to
preserve in literary form the sentiments concerning
eloquence which to my thinking were expressed to
perfection by those consummate orators, if in any
way I should have succeeded in recapturing and
representing their pronouncements3 and lastly, I
protest, to rescue, as far as possible, from disuse and
from silence, the reputation of these men which was

8 already beginning to wane. For could their own
writings have made those orators known, perhaps Ι
should have seen smaller need for this work that
1 have undertaken‚ but as one of them had written
little (at all events little that survived), and had
written that little in early life, while the other had
left nothing whatever in writing, I thought that it
was a tribute due from me to those great intellects,
that while all still held them in living memory I
should render that memory immortal‚ if I could.

9 And my hope is so much the greater that I shall
establish the case which I am approaching, because Ι
am not treating of the eloquence of Servius Galba or
Gaius Carbo, in which case I should be able to invent
at pleasure, no one now surviving to contradict me
with his reminiscences, but I am publishing what will
be criticized by those who have often actually listened
to the men of whom I am speaking, in order that Ι
may recommend an illustrious pair to those who have
never seen either of them, on the testimony of the
recollections of men to whom both those famous
orators were personally known, and who themselves
are living and still among us.
