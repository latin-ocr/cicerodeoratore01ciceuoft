DE ORATORE, II. lxiii. 256—lxiv. 257

see to it that our bon-mot be not thought forced),
we shall still find ourselves delivering very many a
pointed remark.

‘⁴ Another category, which uses a slight change in (3) play
spelling, the Greeks call ‘ assonance‚' when the ἓξοηξζξζΫ
variation is in a letter or two; for example, one
surnamed ‘ the Noble ’ ⁴² was referred to by Cato as
⁴ the Mobile,’ or again Cato said to a certain man,
⁴ Let us go for a deambulation,' and, on the other
asking, ‘ What need of the ‘⁴ de—? ”,' Cato rejoined,

‘ N ay, rather, what need of thee ? ⁹ or take that other
answer of the same Cato’s, ‘ Whether you turn hither

267 or thither, you are filthy.' There is point also in the
explanation of a name, when you make fun of the
reason for a man being called as he is, as I said
the other day of Nummius, the voters’ paymaster,
that he had found a name in the Election Field,⁶ as
Neoptolemus had done at Troy. Now all such jests
hinge upon a word.

LXIV. “ Often too a verse, or some part of one, is (ς) quota·
wittily introduced, either just as it stands or very ξξζξθζῗο,
slightly varied, as when Statius quoted to an angry proverbe:
Scaurus that passage from which, Crassus, some people

would have it that your own Nationality Act ⁶
originated :—

Hist ! Silence ἰ Why this din ἲ Not overbold
Should be the parentless ! Have done with pride!

Doubtless, too, in the affair of Caelius, that jest of
yours, Antonius, helped your cause, when he gave
evidence of having parted with money and, as he
civibus was passed, apparently to prevent the usurpation of
Roman civic rights by Latins and Italians. The lines cited

seem to impute illegitimacy to the person or persons to
whom they were addressed.
