DE ORATORE, ΙΙ. xlvii. 196—xlviii. 198

on that occasion, my address, so far from inspiring
compassion, would positively have deserved ridicule.
And so Ι am telling you this, Sulpicius, as naturally
such a kindly and accomplished teacher would do, in
order to help you to be wrathful, indignant and
tearful in your speech—making.

197 ‘⁴ But why indeed should Ι teach this to you, who,
in prosecuting my comrade and quaestor,⁶ had
kindled such a blaze, not by eloquenee only, but
far more by vehemence, indignation and fiery en-
thusiasm, that I hardly ventured to draw near and
put it out? For all the advantages in that case had
been yours: you were citing to the Court the violence,
the ssight, the stone-throwing and the tribunes’
ruthlessness that marked the disastrous and lament-
able affair of Caepio3 then too it was established
that Marcus Aemilius, chief of Senate and chief of
State, had been struck by a stone, while it was
undeniable that Lucius Cotta and Titus Didius, on
trying to veto a resolution, had been forcibly driven
from sanctuary.

198 XLVIII. “ In the result, while you, only a stripling,
were thought to be conducting this public prosecu-
tion with consummate distinction, I, a past censor,
was thought to be acting not quite honourably in bear-
ing to defend a factious citizen, who moreover had
been merciless to a past consul in distress. Citizens
of the best repute formed the tribunal ; men of re-
spectability crowded the Court ; so that 1 had
difficulty in winning a grudging sort of acceptance
of my plea that at any rate my client was my old
quaestor. In these circumstances how can I say

himself by the aristocrats in 95 13.c., when Antonius con-
ducted his defence, as here described.
