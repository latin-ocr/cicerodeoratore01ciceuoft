DE ORATORE, Ι. xlviii. 210—xlix. 212

210 “,For if the question chanced to be as to the nature The orator,
of the general’ s art, I should think it proper to settle 110le izhethg
at the outset, who 1s a general. and, having defined sstate sman

to the guidance of the State, I should define him
thus: ‘ Whoever knows and uses everything by
which the advantage of a State is secured and
developed, is the man to be deemed the helmsman

leader, of Tiberius Gracchus the elder, Quintus
Metellus, Publius Africanus, Gaius Laelius, and
countless others, some from our own community

who is rightly described as learned in the law, I should
say it is the man who is an expert in the statutes,
and in the customary law observed by individuals
as members of the community, and who is qualified
to advise, direct the course of a lawsuit, and safe-
guard a client, and in this class I should refer to
Sextus Aelius, Manius Manilius and Publius Mucius.
