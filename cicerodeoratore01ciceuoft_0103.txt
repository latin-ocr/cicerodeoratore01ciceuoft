shall say is true—have never failed me at all in my
probings or interrogatories, and have many a time
explained to me what rules you were wont to

of you has opened up a way of reaching these
very objects of our quest, and since it was Crassus
who led off in this discussion, grant us the favour
of recounting with exactness of detail, your re-
spective opinions upon every branch of oratory.
If we do win this boon from you both, I shall be
deeply grateful, Crassus, to this school in your
Tusculan villa, and shall rank these semi-rural
training-quarters of yours far above the illustrious
Academy and the Lyceum.”

Sulpicius, but let us rather ask Antonius, who both

how 1 have invariably run away from all discussions
of this sort, and time and again have refused com-
pliance with your desire and indeed your importunity.

nor because I was unwilling to gratify your entirely
legitimate and admirable keenness—the more so as
Ι had recognized that you were above all other men
eminently endowed by nature and adapted for oratory
—but in solemn truth it was from want of familiarity
