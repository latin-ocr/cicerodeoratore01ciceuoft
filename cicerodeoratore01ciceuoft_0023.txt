INTRODUCTION

(ἓὲ 263-265) Crassus hints that Antonius has only
been displaying his skill in refutation, and requests
him to set out his own view of the matter in the next
day's debate.

-‘ Book ΙΙ (ἓὲ 1-11) Introduction ι Crassus and
Antonius were not unlearned, as is usually supposed ;
such eloquence as theirs must have been based on
wide study. The dialogue following will constitute
a treatise on rhetoric based on more practical experi-
ence than that possessed by previous authors.

(§§ 12-27) The second day's debate. Catulus and
Caesar arrive, and after some conversation about the
employment of leisure‚ Antonius begins to state his
own case. (ἐξ 28-38) He says that oratory cannot be
made into a science, but some rules for speakers can
be derived from observation and experience ; oratory
covers all good speaking and all subjects. (ἐξ 39-73)
He proceeds to consider the proper sphere of rhetoric.
D—egnonstratQQeds no s ecial rules ; nor does
history—he gives a sffivXeyAEcR'ffiffief Greek his-
torians. The rhetoricians formulate no rules for
writing history, nor for the other forms of literature
that require eloquence. The same is true of the
discussion of abstract subJects, for which no rules of
style are needed. Any student who has mastered
the more difficult problems will need no directions as
to the easier ones. Forensic oratory is really the
most difficult kind of oratory.

χ J ἰ (gg 74-89) Catulus teus a story illustrating the
uselessness of theory without practical experience.
Antonius criticizes some superfluous or misleading
rules of rhetoric. The first requisite is natural endow-
ment, as the instance of Sulpicius shows. (§§ 90-98)
There must be constant practice, largely in writing,
