of the schools, for the cases set to the boys are
simple. ‘ Statute forbids a foreigner to mount the

enemy3 he is prosecuted.' It is no trouble to get
up a case like that, and so they are right in giving
no directions for mastering the case, for this is just
about the t pe of wording in cases set in the schools.
But in the aw-courts documents, evidence, informal
agreements, formal contracts, relationship by blood
or marriage, magisterial orders, opinions of counsel,
and finally the life-history of the parties to the pro-
ceedings, must all be examined3 and we see that
it is generally through neglect of these matters that
cases are lost, particularly such as concern private
rights, for these are often of peculiar difficulty.
Thus some practitioners, wishing their business to be
thought large, and themselves to be seen flitting
from lawsuit to lawsuit all round the courts, argue
cases which they have not got up. Herein they incur
very grave reproach, either of carelessness, if their
services are volunteered, or of bad faith, if they are re-
tained ; but that reproach is deemed all the greater,
in that no man can speak, without the direst disgrace‚
on a subject which he has not mastered. And so,
while scorning the accusation of laziness, in reality
the more serious, they encounter as well that of dull-
ness, which they themselves more sedulously avoid.
