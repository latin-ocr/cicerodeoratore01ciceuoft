INTRODUCTION

who disparaged rhetoric altogether, and an Academic,
Charmadas, who held that it should be based on
philosophy, giving examples3 Charmadas denied
any science of rhetoric, saying that oratory depends
merely on natural aptitude and practice, and has
to go to philosophy for matter. Antonius says that
he has never heard real eloquence‚ though it may
be a possibility.

(ἐξ 96-112) Crassus is urged to expound his views
more fully, and with reluctance consents to do so.
(ἐς 102-109) He asks, is there an art ‘² of rhetoric?
This is a question rather for a Greek. But when
pressed he says that there is none, in the strict sense,
although if one reduces the results of observation and
experience to a system one may produce a sort of
art. He is urged to give the results of his own
experience.

(ἐξ 113-262) The requirements of the orator.

(§§113-128) Natural gifts are essential for high
success, although the ideal is hard to attain. Antonius
agrees ε orators are more exposed to criticism than
even actors. (ἐξ 129-136) Crassus concurs, as every
defect is noticed at once. He praises the natural
gifts of Sulpicius and the zeal of Cotta; they only
need training, so he will describe his own method.

(ἓὲ 137-147) He began by taking the school course
in rhetoric, treating (1) the purpose of oratory, (2)
the classification of subjects, (3) the determination
of the point at issue, (4) the three kinds of oratory,
forensic, deliberative and panegyric; (5) its five
divisions, invention, arrangement, style, memory

⁰ It must be remembered that ars means a systematio

treatment of a subject and conveys the sense that we attach
rather to the word ‘ science.’ Of. Book ΙΙ, ξ 30.
