INTRODUCTION

can refer to Wilkjns. It may be noted here that the
accepted text is based on two primary mss. of the
ninth century and one of the tenth, which clearly
come from a single not very much older copy. Though
full of obvious errors in copying, they are free from
deliberate corrections ; all three however are muti-
lated, and they leave considerable gaps in the text
unattested. The same is the case with a more
numerous second set, of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries, which are manifestly based on one or other
of the above or on their common source. A third set,
all of a later date, give a complete text ; but they
do not show the same amount of agreement as the
two earlier groups, and also their value is even more
reduced by the probability that they have been
largely corrupted by conj eetural emendation.
