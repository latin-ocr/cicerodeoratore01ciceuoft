DE ORATORE, ΙΙ. lx. 245—247

The president of the Court, who was in a huri-y,
answered, ‘ Only if you are short.’ ‘ You will not
complain,' returned Philippus, ⁶ for I shall be just
as short as that man is.' Quite comical 3 but there
on the tribunal sat Lucius Aurifex, and he was even
tinier than the witness ε all the laughter was directed
against Lucius, and the joke seemed merely buf-
foonish. And so those shafts which may light upon
unintended victims, however featly they may be
winged, are none the less essentially those of a
buffoon. For instance, that Appius, who tries to be
witty, and egad! succeeds, though occasionally slip-

and even so only said what would apply to every
one-eyed individual. J okes of that sort, as they
seem to be thought out in advance, win but little
laughter. The retort of Sextius was brilliant and
spontaneous t ‘ Wash your hands,’ says he, ‘ before
su er.’⁰

RIl'tegard then to occasions, control and restraint of
our actual raillery‚ and economy in bon—mots, will
distinguish an orator from a buffoon, as also will the
fact that we people speak with good reason, not just
to be thought funny, but to gain some benefit, while
those others are jesting from morning to night, and
without any reason at all. Thus, when Aulus Sern-
pronius was on canvassing bent, along with Marcus
his brother, and embraced Vargula, what good did
it do Vargula to shout ⁴ Boy, drive away these
buzzers ? ’ ὓ His object was to get a laugh—to my
mind the very poorest return for cleverness. The
