for your statement and highly delighted with it,
but we ask for a little more, and especially for those

Crassus, ran over very briefly‚ though owning that,
so far from despising, you had even learned them.

satisfy every hope of our continual longing. For so
far we have heard what objects we must pursue,

Antonius we shall be learning your own views also.”

this burden is laid upon people of our years by the
eagerness of these young men, to express your
sentiments upon these matters which you see are
required of you.'’
