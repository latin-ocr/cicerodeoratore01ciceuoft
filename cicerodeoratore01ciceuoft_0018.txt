made himself master of Rome, he with Marius was
proscribed, and soon after murdered.

C. Aurelius Cotta, a young man of less vigorous
character, cf *fis-§affine age as Sulpicius, attached
himself in a similar manner to Antonius. He also
belonged to the party of conservative reform, but
unlike Sulpicius he remained a moderate and never
joined the extreme reformers. Sulla therefore

his career. He rose to be consul in 75 B.C., and died
the next year, after achieving some minor military
successes as proconsul in Gaul.

seventy years old at the time, having been consul
117 13.c. He was a learned lawyer, and an adherent
of the Stoic philosophy, being a member of the
Hellenizing ‘ Scipionic circle.' In extreme old age
he refused to figure as an adherent of Sulla. Cicero
tells Atticus (ad Att. iv. 16. 3) that he thought it suit-
able to his character and interests to introduce him
at the beginning of the discussion, but due to his
years to spare him the τεχνολογία of the later part.
He is represented as displaying great legal know-
ledge and experience of the world; he somewhat
disparages the value of rhetoric, and questions the
need of a wide literary and philosophie education
for an orator.
