DE ORATORE, II. lix. 242—lx. 245

these.’ ‘² Ι think I am listening to testy Eld personi-
fied. However this particular kind of laughing-
matter is all such as to need extreme circumspection
in the handling of it. For if the caricature is too
extravagant‚ it becomes the work of buffoons in
pantomime‚ as also does grossness. It behoves the
orator to borrow merely a suspicion of mimiery, so
that his hearer may imagine more than meets his
eye3 he must also testify to his own well-bred
modesty‚ by avoiding all unseemly language and
offensive gestures.

243 LX. “ These then are the two kinds of the jesting 'rho latter,
that is founded on facts ; and they are appropriate ζξζξῗηξζᾎω·
to continuous irony, wherein the characters of indi· spuringly.
viduals are sketched and so portrayed, that either
through the relation of some anecdote their real
natures are understood, or, by the infusion of a trifle
of mimicry, they are found out in some fault suffi-
ciently marked to be laughed at.

244 “ As regards words, however, the laughter is
awakened by something pointed in a phrase or re-
flection. But just as, with the former kind, both in
narrative and in mimicry, all likeness to buffoons in
pantomime is to be avoided, so in this latter case the
orator must scrupulously shun all buffoonish raillery.
How then shall we distinguish from Crassus, from
Catulus, and from the others, your familiar acquaint-
ance Granius, or my own friend Vargula ? Upon my
word, I have never considered this matter, for all of
them are witty, none indeed more so than Granius.
The first point to make, I think, is that we should
not feel bound to utter a witticism every time an

245 occasion offers. A very small witness once came
forward. ‘ May I examine him ? ' said Philippus.
