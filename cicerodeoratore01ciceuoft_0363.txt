DE ORATORE, II. xliv. 185-18'7

185 XLIV. “ But closely associated with this is that dis· Importunas
similar style of speaking which, in quite another way, ξῇἶζξὶξῖξωῧ
excites and urges the feelings of the tribunal towards effigiem-111
hatred or love, ill-will or well-wishing, fear or hope, ²¹¹ ⁹⁸⁰⁹·

186 interest will suggest. For, as the saying goes, it is
easier to spur the willing horse than to start the lazy
one. But if no such emotion be present, or recogniz-
able, he will be like a careful physician who, before
he attempts to administer a remedy to his patient,
must investigate not only the malady of the man
he wishes to cure, but also his habits when in health,
and his physical constitution.

“ This indeed is the reason why, when setting about
a hazardous and important case, in order to explore

all possible keenness their thoughts, judgements,
anticipations and wishes, and the direction in which

187 eloquence. If they surrender to me, and as I said
before, of their own accord lean towards and are

prone to take the course in which I am urging them

on, I accept their bounty and set sail for that quarter

which promises something of a breeze. If however

an arbitrator is neutral and free from predisposition,

my task is harder, since everything has to be called
