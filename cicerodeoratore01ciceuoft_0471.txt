DE ORATORE, ΙΙ. lxxviii. 315—318

suitably expressed, must at the same time be appro-
priate to the case in hand ; for the opening passage
contains the first impression and the introduction of

an actual fight to the death between gladiators, where
the decision is made by the steel‚ nevertheless before
closing a number of strokes are made that seem not
to be intended to inflict a wound but to be done for
the sake of appearance, how much more proper is it
for this to be taken into consideration in making a
speech, where what is asked for is not so much force
as entertainment! In conclusion, nothing exists in
the physical universe that emerges as a whole and
develops completely all in a moment : so true is it

a speech must not be drawn from some outside source
but from the very heart of the case; consequently
