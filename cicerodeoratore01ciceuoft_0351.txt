things, and the effects proceeding from causes, and
investigate things of relatively greater, equal or
lesser significance.

167 XL.‘ ‘An instance of proof deduced from connected

terms is: ‘If the highest praise is due to loyalty,
you should be stirred at the sig ht of Quintus Metellus

folk to live but sor the day, our own purposes should
contemplate all time.’ And, in cases involving both
resemblance and difference, analogies are found in
the deeds or the words or the fate of other people,
and feigned tales must often be cited. Again, as a
deduction from an opposite, take ε ⁴ If Gracchus did
