DE ORATORE, I. xxxviii. 174—xxxix. 176

174 ‘⁴ Derision surely befits his presumption, who owns
himself a raw hand in managing smaller barks, while
claiming to have learned the piloting of five-banked
galleys or vessels larger still. When I see you
trapped in a private eonference by a quibble of your
opponent’s, and sealing up your client's deed, such
deed containing the words by which he is defeated,
can Ι think that any ease of real importanee ought to
be entrusted to you? Sooner, Ι vow, shall he who
has upset a pair-oared skiff in harbour navigate the

175 ship of the Argonauts upon the Euxine Sea 1 Suppose
however that the cases are not even trifling, but
osten of the greatest moment, involving a dispute
about the common law: what cheek‚ I ask you,
has that advocate who, without any legal knowledge,
ventures to undertake the conduct of these pro-
ceedings ? What case, for example, could be more
important than that of the well-known soldier, of
whose death false news had arrived home from the
army, and whose father, believing the tale, had
altered his will, and instituted an heir of his own
choosing, and then died himself: the matter came
before the Hundred Commissioners, upon the soldier
returning home and starting an action on the
statute for the recovery of his paternal inheritance,
as a son disinherited by will ? Certainly in this case
the issue was one of common law, that is to say,
whether or not a son could be disinherited in respect
of his father's estate, when such father in his will had
QQme
name.
