DE ORATORE, Ι. xxxiv. 154-157

to declaim upon the actual subject-matter of my
reading, choosing as far as possible different words.
But later Ι noticed this defect in my method,
that those words which best befitted each subject,
and were the most elegant and in fact the best, had

in this work I do not altogether dislike the use as
well, if you are accustomed to it, of that system of
associating commonplaces with symbols ⁶ which is
