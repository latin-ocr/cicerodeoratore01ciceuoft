DE ORATORE, I. liii. 227—229

227 LIII. ‘⁶ And so, although I personally thought these {ndeed
words of yours inspired, Publius Rutilius Rufus, a ΡῙέῘῙζξοὲῖῙῑῖ
man of learning and devoted to philosophy, used ἷῗέξτονοιῖἰ
to say they were not only wanting in discretion, but ῗῖῗῆξθῖθξῗ
positively unseemly and disgraceful. He it was who pleading.
used also to censure very severely Servius Galba,
whom he claimed to remember well, for having
worked upon the compassion of the assembly, when
Lucius Scribonius was moving for his prosecution,
after Marcus Cato, a troublesome and bitter foe to
Galba, had harangued the Roman people in a rough
and violent strain z this speech Cato himself has
recorded in his Early History.

223 ‘⁸ As I was saying, Rutilius used to find fault with
Galba, for having almost hoisted on to his shoulders,
with his own hands, his ward Quintus, the son of
his near relative Gaius Sulpicius Gallus, so that his
appearance might set the assembly a-weeping, by
recalling the memory of his most illustrious father;
and for having committed two small sons of his own
to the guardianship of the nation3 and for having
proclaimed, like a soldier making his will under arms,
without scales or tablets, that he appointed the
Roman people to be their guardians in their father-
less plight. The result, according to Rutilius, was
that Galba, though at that time weighed down by
popular ill-will and hatred, actually secured an
acquittal by means of these histrionics, and I also
find the incident recorded in Cato's book, with the
comment that ‘ but for his employment of boys and
blubbering, the accused would have got his deserts.'

'I‘liese methods Rutilius used roundly to condemn,
affirming that banishment or death itself was better
