DE ORATORE, Ι. lii. 225—226

nations and States, who would have allowed you,
Crassus, for all your high reputation, and all your
splendour as a political leader, to express yourself
as you did before a densely crowded assembly oi
your fellow-citizens ? ‘ Deliver us out of our woes,
deliver us out of the jaws of those whose ferocity
cannot get its fill of our blood3 suffer us not to be
in bondage to any, save to yourselves as a nation,
whose slaves we can and ought to be.' I pass over
‘ woes,' in which, according to the philosophers,
the brave can never become involved3 I pass over
‘ jaws‚' out of which you desire to be delivered, for
fear of your blood being sucked out of you by an un-
just judgement, a thing which they say cannot befall
the wise ; but ‘ slavery,' did you dare to say that not
yourself only, but the entire Senate, whose interests
you were that day upholding‚ could be slaves ?

226 ‘⁴ Can Virtue be a slave, Crassus, according to those
authorities of yours, whose maxims you include
within the range of the orator's knowledge? She
who for ever and alone is free, and who, though the
body be made prisoner of war or bound with chains,
ought still to hold fast to her own rights and un-
restricted freedom in all things! And as for your
further pronouncement, that the Senate not only
‘ can ' but actually ‘ ought to ’ be the slaves of
the nation, could any philosopher be so unmanly,
spiritless and weak, so resolved to make physical
pleasure and pain the standard of everything, as
to approve of this suggestion that the Senate is in
bondage to the nation, when it is to the Senate that
the nation itself has committed the power of con-
trolling and guiding it, as some driver might hand
over his teins ?
