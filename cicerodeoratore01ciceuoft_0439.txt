DE ORATORE, 11. lxvii. 274—lxviii. 276

The silly man,
As soon as he was growing rich he died:¹

Or

Is yonder dame ?-—My wife ἱὲιῐῗὶὲὴὲιῒιέῗέἓῗῐῗι help me! ⁸

orators find room for one of them, with the result that
even a man who is no fool says something in the

‘ you will be able to attend to business of your own?

275 These jokes provoke hearty laughter‚ and so most as-
suredly does everything that is said ironically by the
wise, and somewhat absurdly, but not without humour.

Pontidius, being asked his opinion of the man who is
taken in adultery, replied ι ‘ He is a slowcoach‚’ or as
when, at a muster of troops, Metellus rejected the
excuse Ι pleaded of weak eyesight‚ and said to me,

276 ‘ Can you then see nothing ? '‚ and I replied ‘ On the
contrary, Ι can see your country-mansion from the
Esquiline Gate.’ ‘¹ Another instance was that re-
joinder of Nasica’s: he had called upon the poet
Ennius and, when he inquired for him at his front-

ὅ Said to be a reflection on the ostentatious size and
splendour of the mansion.
