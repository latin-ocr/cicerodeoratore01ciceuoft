DE ORATORE, ΙΙ. iii. 12—iv. 15

the elder suddenly arrived at the house, accompanied
by his brother Gaius Julius. On being informed of
this, Crassus rose in a state of excitement, and general
astonishment prevailed, everyone surmising that the
reason for this visit must be something out of the

13 ordinary. After exchanging very cordial greetings
with one another, as their practice was, Crassus
inquired‚ ‘⁴ What in the world brings you here ?
Have you any news ? ” “ None whatever,'’ replied
Catulus3 “ you see the Games are on. Think us
impertinent or troublesome, as you please, but the
fact is, that on arriving yesterday evening at my
Tusculan villa from his own, Caesar told me that he
had met Scaevola, who was on his way from this
place, and who related to him a marvellous tale, the
purport of which was that you, whom all my induce-
ments, so often employed, could never draw into a
discussion, had been stating your views on oratory at
large, in debate with Antonius, and reasoning as if

upon me to accompany him hither,—not indeed that
I have any particular aversion to playing the part of
a listener, but I vow Ι was afraid that our pushing
in might be troublesome to you-; for he explained
that, according to Scaevola, a good part of the
discourse stood adjourned until to-day. If you think
this action of ours impertinent curiosity, you will
blame Caesar, if it seems an abuse of friendship, you
will blame the pair osus ; for our part we are charmed
to be here, provided always that our coming in does
not happen to be a nuisance.”
