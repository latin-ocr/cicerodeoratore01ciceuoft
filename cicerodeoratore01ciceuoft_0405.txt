DE ORATORE, II. lviii. 235—236

whether willingness to produce it becomes an orator 3
fourth, the limits of his licence ; fifth, the classification
of things laughable-

“ Now the first of these topics, the essential nature (1) it·

times in delivering an attack3 and it shatters or
obstructs or makes light of an opponent, or alarms
or repulses him3 and it shows the orator himself

and, best of all, it relieves dullness and tones down

austerity, and, by a jest or a laugh, often dispels dis-
