excellent brother, that I should try to instruct by
means of a lot of books which you think only crude ;
for what can be more exact or graceful than your
own diction? But whether it be on principle, as you
generally affirm, or from modesty and what I may
call the diffidence of the well-bred, that you have
shrunk from public speaking (as that eminent father
of eloquence, Isocrates, has declared to have been
the case with himself), or whether, as I myself am

in an entire community, still I think that you will not
place this essay among that class of writings which

therein discussed the art of speaking. For to my mind
nothing has been passed over, in the dialogue be-

principles of oratory by your own study, its practice
by my assistance. But in order the sooner to dis-
charge this important duty that we have undertaken‚
let us proceed, without any preamble of mine, to the
discourse and arguments of those orators whom we
have set before us.

On the morrow, then, of that former debate, at
about eight in the morning, while Crassus was still in
bed and Sulpicius sitting by his side, and Antonius
strolling with Cotta in the colonnade, Quintus Catulus
