DE ORATORE, ΙΙ. xxv. 105-108

cases of assassination, poisoning or misappropriation
a denial is the inevitable plea. Thus in Court the
first class of cases is that of disputed facts, · debate
generally proceeds from something still to come,
106 seldom from anything present or past. Often too (ἔξω 1¹2⁸
the question is not whether something be thena
fact or not, but what is its nature3 as, when Ι
heard Gaius Carbo, in his consulship, defending
Lucius Opimius before the people‚ he denied no de-
tail of the killing of Gaius Gracchus, but urged that
it was justifiable and for the public safety3 or as
when Publius Africanus made answer to that very
Carbo (by then a tribune of the commons with
changed political views and putting a question as to
Tiberius Gracchus), that‘ his death appeared to be
justifiabless Now all acts may be defended as justifi- (3) its de n.
able which are such that the doing thereof was a ”¹⁶²⁰ ⁰¹¹·
duty, or permissible‚ or necessary, or which are shown
to have been done inadvertently or by accident.
107 Again the question is one of definition, when the
terms in which an act should be described are in dis-
pute, as in the main contention between myself and
our friend Sulpicius at the trial of Norbanus.⁰ For,
while admitting most of our friend’s indictment, I
still maintained that the defendant was not guilty of
¹ treason,’ since the whole case depended on the con-
struction of this word, by virtue of the Statute of
108 Appuleius.⁶ And in such proceedings some lay down
a rule that each side shall concisely define the de-
batable term, a proposition which I myself always
think thoroughly childish. For definition of terms is
another thing when controversy arises among special-
ists touching the intimate concerns of the arts, for
instance when inquiry is made as to the essentia!
