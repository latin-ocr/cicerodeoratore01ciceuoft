many a Phormio. Is there 1n fact a man among thos prgpisleaqv

Greeks who would credit one of us with understanding ¹¹ s
anything? Not that they worry me so much3 I
gladly suffer and bear with them all. For they either
contribute to my amusement, or contrive to soften

my regret at not having been a student. And I

send them on their ways less contemptuously than
Hannibal sent his philosopher, and for that reason
perhaps I have even more trouble with them ; their

abstract problems. By the concrete they mean a», 42 ,
question in debate and dispute between litigantsgs‘q
by the abstract something involved in boundlessf ‘³34⁵ss
uncertainty. For the treatment of the concrete} “
they lay down rules; as to the other braneh of ‘
7dlloratory their silence is remarkable. After that they

set forth a sort of fivefold division of rhetoric, tos ἦ y
choose what to say, to marshal the chosen material, ef<
next to express it elegantly‚ then to commit it to ζ ³
memory, and in the end actually to deliver it—
assuredly no mysterious progress. For who would not
instinctively realize that no one can make a speech
&without having settled what to say, and in what
terms and sequence, and without remembering all this?

And without complaining of this classification I say

it is one that is obvious, as also are those four, five,

six or even seven subdivisions (for different authorities

adopt different analyses) into which these people
