PREFACE

Tuouon his name does not appear on the title-page,
any merit diseoverable in the translation of De
Oratore, Book Ι is largely due to my friend Mr.
Charles Stuttaford‚ sometime of Amersham Hall
School. Originally entrusted with the execution of
both these volumes, he had done much preliminary
work on the text and translation of Book Ι, when
reasons of health compelled him to relinquish his
task. Ι most gratefully acknowledge my heavy
indebtedness to his labours.

Tm: late Mr. E. W. Sutton left at his death only
the MS. and proof of his translation of De Oratore,
Book I, and three-quarters of Book ΙΙ, at various
stages of correction. Ι have completed the volume.

An index will be found in Volume Two, which
contains De Oratore, Book III, De Fato, Paradoxa
Stoicorum, and De Partitione Oratoria.
