DE ORATORE, ΙΙ. xvi. 68-’70

68 reasonable limits. Of course I hold that all things
relating to the intercourse of fellow-citizens and the
ways of mankind, or concerned with everyday life,
the politica] system, our own corporate society, the
common sentiments of humanity, natural inclinations
and morals must be mastered by the orator ; if not in
the sense that he is to advise on these matters one by
one, as the philosophers do, yet so far at least as to
enable him to weave them skilfully into his discourse,
and moreover to speak of these very things in the
same way as the founders of rules of law, statutes
and civil communities spoke, frankly and lucidly,
with no formal train of argument or barren verbal
controversy.

69 “ And here, to prevent any surprise at my omitting
to lay down any regulations on so many highly
important subjects, I make this declaration : ‘ Just
as in the other arts, when the hardest portions of each
have been taught, the rest, through being either
easier or just like the former, call for no teaching3
as in painting, for instance, he who has thoroughly
learned how to paint the semblance of a man, can
without further lessons paint one of any figure or
time of life, nor is there any danger that he, who
would paint to admiration a lion or bull, will be
unable to do the like with many other four-footed
animals (there being no art whatever wherein all its
possibilities require professorial teaching, since those
who have rightly learned the general principles of
fundamental and established things attain the rest

70 without difficulty and unaided) 3 even so I hold that
in this oratory, be it an art or the outcome of
practice, he who has acquired such power as to be
able to sway at his pleasure the minds of hearers
