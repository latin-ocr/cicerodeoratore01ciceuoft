DE ORATORE, Ι. xxxvii. 171—xxxviii. 1¹73

equalled knowledge of the common law ? It is with
some diffidence that I have been so long diseussing
this topic, when we have with us the greatest of
speakers, a man whom Ι admire above all others as
an unique orator, but who nevertheless has always

172 despised this common law. Since however you have
sought to be partakers of my view and my judgement,
Ι will suppress nothing but, so far as lies in my power,
will lay before you what Ι think upon every point.

XXXVIII. “ In Antonius what I may call a Only genius

marvellous and almost unrivalled and godlike power ffiffffiffisssss
of genius seems, even without the protection of this γ’
legal knowledge, to be able easily to guard and
defend itself with the rest of the armouryr of
practical wisdom. Let him then be left out of our
indictment but, as for the rest, I shall not hesitate
to give my vote for a verdict of ‘ Guilty,' first of

1731aziness and secondly of effrontery as well. For to
flit around the Courts, to loiter about the Bench and
judgement-seats of the praetors, to engage in civil
proceedings involving weighty interests, in which
the dispute is often not as to facts but as to equity
and law, to vaunt oneself in cases before the Hundred
Commissioners,‘² where are debated the rights con-
cerning long user, guardianship, clanship, relation-
ship through males, alluvial accessions, the formation
of islands, obligations, sales, party-walls, ancient
lights, rain-drip from the eaves, the revocation or
establishment of wius, and all those other matters
innumerable, when a man is wholly ignorant as to
what is his own and what another’s, and even of the
essential difference between citizen and foreigner,
or between bond and free, this is the mark of no
ordinary effrontery.
