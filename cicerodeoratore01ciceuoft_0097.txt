DE ORATORE, Ι. xx. 90-91

90 rhetoricians were teaching. More than once too he
was carried so far away by his discourse as to argue
that there was no such thing as an art of eloquence ;
and after showing this by arguments—because, as
he said, we were born with an aptit-ude alike for
coaxing and unctuously stealing into favour with
those from whom a boon had to be sought, and for
daunting our antagonists by threats, for setting forth
how a deed was done, and establishing our own
charges and disproving the allegations of the other
side, and for making, in the closing words of a
speech, some use of protest and lamentation (in
which operations he declared that every resource of
the orator was brought into play), and because habit
and practice sharpened the edge of discernment and
quickened the fluency of delivery, then he would also

91 support his case by an abundance of instances. For
in the first place (he would say) not a single writer on
rhetoric—it looked as if of set purpose-had been
even moderately eloquent, and he searched all the
way back to the days of one Coraxa and a certain
Tisias who, he stated, were acknowledged to have
been the founders and first practitioners of this
art, while on the other hand he would cite a
countless host of very eloquent men who had never
learned these rules or been at all anxious to make
their acquaintance3 and among these—whether in
jest or because he thought so and had even so heard
—he went on to mention me in the list, as one who
had never studied those matters and yet (according
to him) had some ability in oratory. To one of these
points of his—that Ι had never learned anything—I
readily agreed, but as to the other Ι considered that
he was either making game of me or was even himself
