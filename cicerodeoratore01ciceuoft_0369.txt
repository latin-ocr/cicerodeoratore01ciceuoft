DE ORATORE, ΙΙ. xlvi. 192-194

public debate, when not only our talent is under
criticism (no great matter, though even this should
not be overlooked, when you have claimed a pro-
ficiency attained by few), but other and far more
important attributes are on trial, I mean our loyalty,
sense of duty and carefulness, under whose influence‚
even when defending complete strangers, we still
cannot regard them as strangers, if we would be

193 accounted good men ourselves. However, as Ι said,
not to have this seem a marvel among us, what can
be so unreal as poetry, the theatre or stage-plays ?
And yet, in that sort of things, I myself have often
been a spectator when the actor-man's eyes seemed
to me to be blazing behind his mask, as he spoke
those solemn lines‚‘²

Dal-est thou part from thy brother, or Salamis enter without
Drealdlilrl} the mien of thy sire not at all ?

Never did he utter that word ‘ mien,' without my
beholding an infuriated Telamon maddened by grief
for his son. Whenever too he lowered his voice
to a plaintive tone, in the passage,“

Aged and childless,
Didst tear and bereave and didst quench me, forgetting the
death of thy brother,
Forgettin his tiny son, though entrusted to thee as a
guar ian?

Ι thought I heard sobs of mourning in his voice.
Now if that player‚ though acting it daily, could
never act that scene without emotion, do you really
think that Pacuvius, when he wrote it, was in a calm
and careless frame of mind? That could never be.
194 For I have often heard that—as they say Democritus
