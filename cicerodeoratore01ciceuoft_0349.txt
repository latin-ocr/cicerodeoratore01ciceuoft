DE ORATORE, ΙΙ. xxxix. 163-166

derived from the essential nature of the case, or
adopted from without ? Intrinsic arguments, when
the problem concerns the character of the subject
as a whole, or of part of it, or the name it is to bear,
or anything whatever relating to the subject3 ex-
trinsic arguments, on the other hand, when topics
are assembled from without and are not inherent in

sources or common-places ; for we shall investigate
connected terms, and general heads with their
sub-divisions, and resemblances and differences, and
opposites, and corresponding and concurrent circum-
stances, and so-called antecedents, and contra-
dictories, and we shall track down the causes of
