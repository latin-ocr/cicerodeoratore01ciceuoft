DE ORATORE, Ι. xxxii. 148—xxxiii. 151

148 “ This training,'’ said Sulpicius, “ is the very thing
we wish to understand: and none the less we are
longing to hear you on those precepts of the art over
which you have briefly run, although those too are
not unknown to us. But of them presently ; for the
moment we want your opinion on the training itself.”

149 ΧΧΧΙΙΙ. “ Ι certainly approve,” replied Crassus,
“ of what you yourselves are in the habit of doing,
when you propound some case, closely resembling
such as are brought into Court, and argue it in a
fashion adapted as nearly as possible to real life.
Most students however, in so doing, merely exercise
their voices (and that in the wrong way), and their
physical strength, and whip up their rate of utteranee‚
and revel in a flood of verbiage. This mistake is due
to their having heard it said that it is by speaking

150 that men as a rule become speakers. But that other
adage is just as true,—that by speaking badly men
very easily succeed in becoming bad speakers. This
is why, in those exercises of your own, though there
is a value in plenty of extempore speaking, it is still
more serviceable to take time for consideration, and
to speak better prepared and more carefully. But
the chief thing is what, to tell the truth, we do least
(for it needs great pains which most of us shirk)‚—
to write as much as possible. The pen is the best and
most eminent author and teacher of eloquence, and
rightly so. For if an extempore and casual speech is
easily beaten by one prepared and thought-out, this
latter in turn will assuredly be surpassed by what has

161 been written with care and diligence. The truth is
that all the commonplaces, whether furnished by art
or by individual talent and wisdom, at any rate such
as appertain to the subject of our writing, appear
