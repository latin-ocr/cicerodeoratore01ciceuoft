DE ORATORE, II. lxxiv. 298-300

by Crassus is of course the verdict of a quite out-
standing and unrivalled intellect—-of course he deems
it miraculous that any speaker could be found whose
oratory would actually damage and prejudice the

capable of achieving, the professor asserted that it
would enable him to remember everything3 and
Themistocles replied that he would be doing him a
greater kindness if he taught him to forget what he

you observe what mental force and penetration the
man possessed, what power and range of intellect?

nothing that had once been introduced into his mind
had ever been able to pass out of it, inasmuch as he
would rather have been able to forget something that
he did not wish to remember than to remember
everything that he had once heard or seen. But this
reply of Themistocles must not cause us to neglect
the training of the memory, and the exceptional
intellectual powers of Crassus must not make us
