DE ORATORE, II. xlv. 189—xlvi. 192

own case there is no reason why I should lie to men
of consummate experience, who are also my best
friends z I give you my word that I never tried, by
means of a speech, to arouse either indignation or
compassion‚ either ill-will or hatred, in the minds of
a tribunal, without being really stirred myself,
as I worked upon their minds, by the very feelings

190 to which I was seeking to prompt them. For it is
not easy to succeed in making an arbitrator angry

the right party, unless he first sees you on fire with
hatred yourself3 nor will he be prompted to com-
passion, unless you have shown him the tokens of
your own grief by word, sentiment, tone of voice,
look and even by loud lamentation. For just as
there is no substance so ready to take fire, as to be
capable of generating flame without the application
of a spark, so also there is no mind so ready to absorb
an orator’s influence, as to be inflammable when the
assailing speaker is not himself aglow with passion.

those reflections and commonplaces, discussed and
handled in a speech, is great enough to dispense
with all make-believe and trickery: for the very
quality of the diction, employed to stir the feelings
of others, stirs the speaker himself even more deeply

astonished at this happem‘ng in litigation, or before
arbitrators, or in the impeachments of our friends,

or among a crowd of people‚ or in political life, or
