DE ORATORE, 11. lxix. 278-280

anybody could be so hard—hearted as not to have
279 thought your speech a pitiable performance.' For

my own part Ι vow 1 am also much amused by those

pettish and rather ill-tempered jests—but not when

Pubilius Rutilius,’ whereas Rutilius said they meant
⁸ Allocated formerly, posted up recently,' Sir Gaius
Canius, who appeared for Rufus, called out that both
