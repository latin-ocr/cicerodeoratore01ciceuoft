DE ORATORE, II. ΗΧ. 239—242

“ For there are two types of wit, one employed upon wit or
240 facts, the other upon words. Upon facts, whenever aef‘ttffirfgffl.
any tale is told, some anecdote for instance, just as the former'

you, Crassus, alleged one day, in a speech against ἓζζέἆῗξὲῃὲ

orator is a jest of this sort, whether you have some

state your incidents in such a way, that the character,
the manner of speaking and all the facial expressions
of the hero of your tale, are so presented that those
incidents seem to your audience to take place and
to be transacted concurrently with your description
242 of them. Another sort of Jest depending on facts,
is that which is generally derived from what may be
called vulgarized mimicry, as when on another occa-
sion, Crassus was adjuring an adversary in the words,
‘ By your rank, by your lineage l ' What else had the
assembly to laugh at in this than that mimicry of
facial expression and intonation ? But when he went
on to say, ⁴ By your statuary,' and lent a touch of
action to the word by stretching out his arm, we
laughed quite consumedly.⁶ To this class belongs
Roscius’s famous representation of an old man, when
he quavers out, ⁴ For you, son Antipho, I’m planting
