EnrrmNs

De Oratore was first printed at Subiaco about 1465,
(in fact it was the very first book printed in Italy) and
three other Italian editions followed in fifteen years.

All subsequent editions have been supplanted by
that of A. S. Wilkins, Oxford, 1892, the earliest con-
taining a commentary in English. Its introduction
is a mine of information on the text and contents of
the book and the earlier history of rhetoric in Greeee
and Rome.

Tnx'r

The present edition has been printed from the text
of V. Betolaud, Paris, no date. A few corrections
have been introduced from the text and notes of
Wilkins, and a few variants are noted at the foot
of the page.
