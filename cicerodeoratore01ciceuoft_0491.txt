DE ORATORE, II. lxxxiv. 342—344

that the qualitics that are desirable in a person are
not the same as those that are praiseworthy ε family,
good looks, bodily strength, resources, riches and
the rest of the externa] or personal gifts of fortune
do not in themselves contain any true ground for
praise, which is held to be due to virtue alone ; but
nevertheless, as it is in the employment and wise
management of these that virtue itself is very largely

of nature and of fortune in which the highest praise
is not to have been puffed up in office or insolent
in wealth, or to have put oneself in front of others
because of fortune’s bounty—-so that wealth and
riches may seem to have provided opportunity and
occasion not for pride and licence but for beneficenee
343 and temperance. But virtue, which is praiseworthy
in itself and is a necessary clement in anything that
can be praised, nevertheless contains several divisions,
one of which is more fit to be praised than another.
For there are some virtues that are manifested as
qualities of people’s behaviour and by a sort of kind-
ness and beneficence, while others consist in intel-
lectual ability or in highmindedness and strength of
character ; inasmuch as mercy, justice, kindness,
fidelity, courage in common dangers are acceptable

thought to be beneficial not so much to their
possessors as to the human race in general, whereas
wisdom, and magnanimity that counts all human
fortunes slight and worthless, and stren h and
originality of intellect, and eloquence itsel are not
less admired it is true but give less pleasure, because
they seem to grace and to safeguard the subjects of
our panegyrics themselves rather than the persons
