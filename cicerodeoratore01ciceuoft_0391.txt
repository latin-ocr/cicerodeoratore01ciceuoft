DE ORATORE, ΙΙ. liv. 217-220

I entertained the hope of being able to learn some-
thing from them, and did indeed find much in Greek
life that was laughable and pungent, the inhabitants
of Sicily, Rhodes, Byzantium, and particularly Athens
having distinguished themselves in this kind of thing3
all however who tried to teaeh anything like a theory
or art of this matter proved themselves so conspicu-
ously silly that their very silliness is the only laugh-
218 able thing about them. That is why Ι think that
this accomplishment cannot possibly be imparted by
teaching. For, there being two sorts of wit, one
running with even flow all through a speech, while the ·
other, though incisive, is intermsttent, the ancients
called the former ‘irony ’ and the latter ‘ raillery.'
219 Each of these has a trivial name, but then of course
all this business of laughter-raising is trivial. For all
that, Antonius, as you remind me, I have very often
seen much done in Court by humour and flashes of
wit. But, while. Art is not wanted in that continuous
sort of jocularity (since Nature moulds mankind, and
produces mimics and witty story-tellers, helped by
their features, intonation and individual style of
speaking), what room, pray, is there for Art in raillery,
that other sort, wherein the shaft of wit has to be
sped and hit its mark, with no palpable pause for
220 thought ? For what help could my brother here mustra-
have got from Art, when Philippus ⁰ inquired of him, “⁰¹²³ ⁰¹ ’Μ’
‘ What are you barking at, Master Puppy,’ and he
answered, ‘ I see a thief ' ? Or what help could
Crassus have so got, all through his reply to Scaevola
before the Hundred Commissioners‚ or his defence of
Gnaeus Plancus, when prosecuted by Brutus? In
fact, Antonius, the tribute you pay me ought, by
unanimous verdict, to be yielded to Crassus. For
