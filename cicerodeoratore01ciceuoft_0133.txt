DE ORATORE, I. xxxii. 144-147

[44 XXXII. “I had listened also to the traditional Rulqs of
precepts tor the embellishment of discourse itself: d¹⁰¹²¹⁰¹²
that we must speak, in the first place, pure and
correct Latin, secondly with simple lucidity, thirdly
with elegance, lastly in a manner befitting the
dignity of our topics and with a certain grace ; and
on these several points I had learnt particular

[45 maxims. Moreover Ι had seen art called in to aid
even those qualities which are peculiarly the endow-
ment of nature: for example, concerning delivery
and the memory, Ι had taken a taste of certain rules
which, though concise, involved much practice.

“For it is matters like these that employ nearly practice

all the learning of your professors3 and if I were essenmal.
to call this learning useless, I should be lying.
For in fact it contains certain reminders, as it were,
for the orator, as to the standard he must apply on
each occasion, and must keep in mind, if he is not

to wander from whatever course he has set himself.

146 But to my thinking the virtue in all the rules is, not
that orators by following them have won a reputation
for eloquence, but that certain persons have noted
and collected the doings of men who were naturally
eloquent : thus eloquence is not the offspring of the
art, but the art of eloquence: even so, as Ι said before,
I do not reject art, for though perhaps hardly essential
to right speaking, still it is no ignoble help towards

147 right knowledge. There is also a certain practical
training that you must undergo—though indeed you
two are already in full career,—-I mean it is for those
who are at the start of their race, and can even thus
early learn beforehand and practise, by a training
like that for the games, what will have to be done in
the fighting-line, so to speak, of the Courts.”
