DE ORATORE, Ι. xiii. 58—xiv. 61

orators3 or let our own folk prefer in this regard
the Ten Commissioners—who wrote out the Twelve
Tables and were necessarily men of practieal wisdom
——to Servius Galba and your father-in—law Gaius
Laelius, whose outstanding renown for eloquence is
59 established. For never will I say that there are not
certain arts belonging exclusively to those who have
employed all their energies in the mastery and exer-
eise thereof, but my assertion will be that the com-
plete and finished orator is he who on any matter
whatever can speak with fullness and variety.

XIV. “ Indeed in handling those causes which The omo„
everybody acknowledges to be within the exclusive {ffisgfffw
sphere of oratory, there is not seldom something to ’
be brought forth and employed, not from practice in
public speaking—the only thing you allow the orator
—but from some more abstruse branch of knowledge.

60 I ask, for instance, whether an advocate can either
assail or defend a commander-in-chief without ex-
perience of the art of war, or sometimes too without
knowledge of the various regions of land or sea?
Whether he can address the popular assembly in
favour of the passing or rejection of legislative pro-
posals, or the Senate concerning any of the depart-
ments of State administration, if he lack consummate
knowledge—practical as well as theoretical——of
political science ? Whether a speech can be directed
to inflaming or even repressing feeling and passion
—a faculty of the first importance to the orator-
unless the speaker has made a most careful search
into all those theories respecting the natural char-
acters and the habits of conduct of mankind, which
are unfolded by the philosophers ?

61 ‘⁶ And I rather think I shall come short of convincing
