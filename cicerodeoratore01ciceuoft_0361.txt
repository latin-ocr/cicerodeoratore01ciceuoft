DE ORATORE, ΙΙ. xliii. 182-184

thing you are really anxious to prove. It is very help-
ful to display the tokens of good—nature, kindness,
calmness, loyalty and a disposition that is pleasing
and not grasping or covetous, and all the qualities
belonging to men who are upright, unassuming and
not given to haste, stubbornness, strife or harshness,

accordingly the very opposites of these qualities

183 must be ascribed to our opponents. But all this kind
of advocacy will be best in those cases wherein the
arbitrator's feelings are not likely to be kindled by
what I may call the ardent and impassioned onset.
For vigorous language is not always wanted, but often
such as is calm, gentle, mild ε this is the kind that most
commends the parties. By ‘ parties ’ Ι mean not only
persons impeached, but all whose interests are being
determined, for that was how people used the term

184 in the old days. And so to paint their characters
in words, as being upright, stainless, conscientious,
modest and long-suffering under injustice, has a
really wonderful effect; and this topic, whether in
opening, or in stating the case, or in winding-up, is
so compelling, when agreeably and feelingly handled,
as often to be worth more than the merits of the
case. Moreover so much is done by good taste
and style in speaking, that the speech seems to
depict the speaker’s character. For by means of
particular types of thought and diction, and the
employment besides of a delivery that is unruffled
and eloquent of good-nature, the speakers are made
to appear upright, well-bred and virtuous men.
