function of joking ; as the shortest possible example
of this you-may very well take Crassus's tale about
Memmius,“ which Ι cited before. To this class we

265 may also refer the stories in the fables. Material is
derived too from history, as when Sextus Titius was
describing himself as a Cassandra,⁶ and Antonius
commented, ‘ Ι can name many who played Ajax,
the son of Oileus, to your Cassandra.’

‘¹ Another source of such pleasantry is resemblance, componam,
involving either comparison or something like por-
traiture. Comparison is illustrated by that Gallus,
who once upon a time gave evidence against Piso
that Piso’s lieutenant Magius had received vast sums
of money, which testimony Scaurus was for con-
tradicting by proving the straitened circumstances of
Magius, whereupon Gallus observed, ‘ You are
missing the point, Scaurus, for Ι (10 not assert that
Magius still has this fund, but that he has tucked it
away in his paunch, like a naked man who goes
nutting.' ⁶ To take another instance, the eminent
Marcus Cicero the elder, father of the best man of
our time, our own friend, said that our contemporaries
were like the Syrian slave-market: ⁴ the better know-
ledge they had of Greeks, the more worthless were
their respective characters.'

266 ‘⁶ Caricatures also provoke loud laughter: as a rule caricam-0,
they are levelled against ugliness or some physical
defect, and involve comparison with something a little
unseemly ; an example was that remark of mine to
Helvius Mancia, ‘ I will now show what manner of
man you are‚' to which he answered, ‘ Pray show
me‚’ whereupon Ι pointed out with my finger a Gaul
depicted on the Cimbrian shield of Marius,‘¹ which
