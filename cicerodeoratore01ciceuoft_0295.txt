DE ORATORE, ΙΙ. xx. 85—xxi. 88

I see in an outstanding orator who is also a man of
worth. But if he seems likely, after doing his utmost
in every way, to attain only the level of the ordinary
speaker, Ι will leave him to his own choice and not
worry him much, while, if he prove wholly un-
suitable and out of his element, I will recommend
either sels-repression or recourse to some other

86 vocation. For by no means must a man of the
highest capacity be left without our encouragement,
or one of any ability scared away, since to my mind
the state of the former partakes in a sense of the
godlike, while the other course, that of refraining
from doing what you cannot do perfectly‚ or doing
what you can do without complete discredit, is
natural to a gentleman. But that third alternative
of bawling, in defiance of propriety and of the
speaker's own limitations, marks the man who, as
you, Catulus, observed of a certain bawler, assembles
as many witnesses of his folly as he can, by acting as

87 his own erier. Of him then, who shall be found
deserving of our encouragement and help, let us so
speak as to impart to him merely what practice has
taught us, so that under our leadership he may ἢν
reach that stage at which we ourselves have arrived CCX
without a leader, since better teaching we cannot Q}

here, I first heard Sulpicius, when he. was almost a {2¹32ssss
boy, in a petty case: as to intonation, presence, ately
bearing and the other essentials he was well fitted eulnvated.
for this function we are investigating, but his delivery
was rapid and impetuous-—the result of his genius—,
his diction agitated and a little too exuberant, as
was natural at his age. Ι did not underrate him,
