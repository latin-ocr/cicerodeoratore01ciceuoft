INTRODUCTION

(§§ 30-95) Oratory, its nature and range.

(ἓέ 30-34) Crassus praises oratory as of prima
importance to society and the state: the orator s
position is eminent, gratifying and powerful for
good; he excels in the very gift wherein man is
superior to animals, ‘ discourse of reason.'

(ἐξ 35-44) Scaevola objects that Crassus overrates
the politica] influence of orators and exaggerates the
range of their powers ε they are often incapable of
dealing with questions of law, philosophy and science.
Their proper sphere is the law-courts and politica]
debates.

(ξὲ 45-57) Crassus replies that this is indeed the
Greek view, but it puts the function of oratory too
low. Yet even if thus limited to polities it calls for
wide knowledge, and on the other hand men of
science and philosophers borrow style from oratory,
although style is not as essential for them as a com-
mand of matter is essential for the orator, especially
in order to control the emotions of the audience.
(§§ 58-68) Eloquence does not itself bestow political
knowledge, but the orator must be well versed in
political and also moral science. (ἐς 69-73) In power
of expression and range of subject he compares with
the poet3 and his style will reveal whether he has
had a wide education.

(§§ 74:79) Scaevola repeats that such a range of
knowledge is beyond the reach os most orators.
Crassus disclaims it himself, but maintains it as the
ideal.

(ἐξ 80-95) Antonius thinks that so much knowledge
is unattainable in a practical career, and also likely
to form a style too abstract to be useful. He reports
a debate at Athens between a Stoic‚ Menedemus,
