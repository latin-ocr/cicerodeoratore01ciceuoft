DE ORATORE, ΙΙ. lxxii. 291—294

LXXII. For my part when I am launched on a case
and have to the best of my ability passed all the facts
under consideration, having discemed and ascer-
tained the arguments that belong to the 0350 and
also the topics calculated to win the favour of the
court and those adapted to arouse its emotions‚ I
then decide what are the good and what the bad
points in the case of each of the parties, as it is almost
impossible for any matter to be brought under dis-
cussion or dispute which does not contain both—the
thing that matters is how much of them it contains ;
292 but my own method in a speech usually is to take
the good points of my case and elaborate these, em-
bellishing and enlarging and lingering and dwelling
on and sticking to them, while any bad part or weak-
ness in my case I leave on one side, not in such 3
manner as to give the appearance of running away
from it but so as to disguise it and entirely cover it
up by embellishing and amplifying the good point
referred to; and if the case is one that turns on
arguments, I maintain all the strongest among them
in the fullest measure, whether they are several or
only one, or if it is a matter of winning favour or
arousing feeling, I concentrate particularly on the
part of the case that is most capable of influencing
293 men’s minds. In short, the chief thing in a case of
this kind is, if my speech 0311 be stronger in refuting
our opponent than in proving our own points, for me
to concentrate all my shafts upon him, but if on the
contrary our points can be more easily proved than
his 0311 be refuted, to aim at drawing off their atten-
tion from our opponent's defence and directing it to
294 our own. Finally there are two lines that appear
extremely easy—as the more difficult ones are beyond
