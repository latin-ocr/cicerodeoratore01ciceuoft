DE ORATORE, II. lviii. 236—lix. 239

tasteFul suggestions not easily weakened by reason-
1n .

237 ξεΒιιῒ the limits within which things laughable are (4) limita of
to be handled by the orator, that fourth question ¹¹²³ ”⁸⁰²
we put to ourselves‚ is one calling for most careful
consideration. For neither outstanding wickedness,
such as involves crime, nor, on the other hand, out-
standing wretchedness is assailed by ridicule, for the
public would have the villainous hurt by a weapon
rather more formidable than ridicule3 while they
dislike mockery of the wretched, except perhaps if
these bear themselves arrogantly. And you must
be especially tender of popular esteem, so that you
do not inconsiderately speak ill of the well-beloved.

238 LIX. ‘⁴ Such then is the restraint that, above all (5) its
else, must be practised in jesting. Thus the things gfflssssffed
most easily ridiculed are those which call for neither
strong disgust nor the deepest sympathy. This is
why all laughing-matters are found among those
blemishes noticeable in the conduct of people who
are neither objects of general esteem nor yet full of
misery, and not apparently merely fit to be hurried off
to execution for their crimes ; and these blemishes,

239 if deftly handled, raise laughter. In ugliness too
and in physica] blemishes there is good enough matter
for jesting‚ but here as elsewhere the limits of licence
are the main question. As to this, not only is there
a rule excluding remarks made in bad taste, but also,
even though you could say something with highly
comical effect, an orator must avoid each of two
dangers: he must not let his jesting become
buffoonery or mere mimicking. We shall more
readily understand examples of each kind when we
come to the actual classification of things laughable.
