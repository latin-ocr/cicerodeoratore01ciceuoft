see the birds fashioning and building their nests, with
a view to raising families and to their own comfort,
but yet, as soon as any part of their task is done, seek-
ing some relief from their toil by flying about at
random in full freedom from work, so in like manner
our human minds, when worn out by the business of
the Courts and the work of the City, grow restless and
yearn to go a-roving, in freedom from worry and

unless it be of your drafting, all we citizens will come
to you with our tablets, and you alone shall draw the
wills of us all, but in that event,’ I went on,

proposition, ‘ For to my mind he is no free man, who
is not sometimes doing nothing.' To that view,
Catulus, I still adhere, and it is just this inaction and
utter idleness that charm me on my comings to this
lace.

neither by the most ignorant nor the most learned,
since the former class understood nothing, and the
latter possibly more than he himself did, in which
