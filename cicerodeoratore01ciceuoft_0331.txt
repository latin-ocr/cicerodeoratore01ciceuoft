DE ORATORE, 11. xxxii. 139—141

enter into the inquiry, but it must be understood
that the cases do not depend upon these, but upon
general questions. This however is nothing to me,
for we are not obliged to quarrel with those people.
It is quite enough to make it known that they have
not even succeeded in distinguishing different classes
of things, and in describing them a little more
accurately, as with their unbounded leisure they
could have done, even though they lacked our own
140 public practice. But this, as I said, is nothing to
me. What is important to me, and far more so
to you, friends Cotta and Sulpicius, is that, in
the present stage of those men’s attainments, a
multiplicity of cases is greatly to be feared ; for their
variety is endless if they are identified with indi-
viduals ; every man then has his case ; but, if they
are brought under general heads of inquiry, they are
so ordinary and so few that careful and thoughtful

from Manius Curius‚“ and for that reason adduced
all those grounds for holding Curius entitled to
succeed as heir to Coponius, though no posthumous
141 son had been born. The identity of Coponius or of
Curius had nothing to do with the wealth of argu-
ment or with the essential character of the case.
The whole inquiry turned upon an abstract question,
founded in the facts of the matter, not in any occasion
or personalities ε the words in the will being ‘ If a
son is born to me, and such son dies before, etc„ then let
So-and-so be my heir,’ and no son having in fact been
born, ought that party to inherit who was nominated
