fortune deserving of compassion, and any facts that
will tell against a false charge ; from one's opponent,
more or less the contrary assertions derived from the

322 same topics3 from the matter charged, in case it

is cruel or outrageous or improbable or undeserved
or pitiable or showing ingratitude or unworthy or un-
precedented or not admitting of compensation or
remedy3 from the members of the court, considera-
tions designed to make them favourable and well-
disposed towards us, which is better achieved by
developing our case than by making a request for
goodwill. Conciliation of the audience must indeed
permeate the whole of the speech, and especially the
peroration, but nevertheless this class of considera-
tion does supply a great many modes of opening.

323 For the Greeks advise us to use the opening passage

for securing the attention of the judge and making
him receptive, and these are valuable things, though
they do not belong more to the introduction than to
the other parts of a speech 3 moreover they are easier
in the introduction, because the audience are most
attentive when they have the whole of the speech to
look forward to, and also they are more receptive at
the start, for statements made at the beginning,
whether aimed at proof or at refutation, stand out
clearer than those made in the middle of a case.

324 But we shall derive our greatest supply of openings

designed either to conciliate or to stimulate the judge
from topics contained in the case that are calculated
to produce emotions, though it will not be proper to
develop these fully at the start, but only to give a
slight preliminary impulsion to the judge, so that the
remainder of our speech may find him already biassed

325 in our direction. LXXX. But the opening passage
