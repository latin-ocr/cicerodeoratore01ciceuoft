lands in public ownership and the Lex Thoria, and
Lucilius ‘² was being attacked by members who asserted
that his herd was being grazed on the lands in ques·
tion, said ‘ No, that herd does not belong to Lucilius ;
you are making a mistake ’—this sounded as if he
were speaking in Lucilius's defence—‘ My own view
is that it is a herd that’s got free—it grazes freely

285 where it pleases.' Ι also like the remark of the
Scipio who made away with Tiberius Gracchus ε
when Marcus Flaccus after a great many damaging
objections had been made had carried Publius Mucius
as a member of the jury, Scipio said ‘ I challenge
him on oath: he is prejudiced Ξ '3 at this there was
a murmur, but Scipio continued, ⁸ Ah, gentlemen,
Ῑ don't challenge him as prejudiced against myself,
but as prejudiced against everybody.’ From this
point of view however nothing could be wittier than
the remark of Crassus: serious damage had been
done to the case of a certain Piso by a witness named
Silus, who had said that he had heard something
against him ; ‘ It may be the case, Silus‚' said Crassus,
‘ that the person whose remark you say you heard
was speaking in anger? Silus nodded assent. ⁴ It
is also possible that you misunderstood him.’ To
this also Silus nodded very emphatic assent, so
putting himself into Crassus's hands. ⁸ It is also
possible,' he continued, ‘ that what you say you
heard, you never really heard at all.’ This was so
entirely unexpected a turn that the witness was
overwhelmed by a burst of laughter from the whole
court. Novius is full of quips of this sort : everyone
knows his jape, ⁴ Even a philosopher like you, if he is -
cold, will shiver,' and a great many more.
