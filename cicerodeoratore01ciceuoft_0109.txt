DE ORATORE, Ι. xxiii. 106-109

and not to run away from the discussion into which
two young men of eminent ability are desirous of
your entering.''

107 ‘⁴ For my part,” answered the other, “ I am No, themis
anxious to humour your friends, and I shall make no pottgscigqee
difficulty about saying, in my brief fashion, what I ssgnseffiulzwt
think upon each point. And to that first question— expenenee

since I do not think it dutifuL Scaevola, for me to ἓᾶεζνξὲἒιῗιίῗιῑ

disregard your claims——I answer, ‘ I think there is '⁰¹⁰⁸‘
either no art of speaking at all or a very thin
one,' all the quarrelling in learned circles being

108 really based upon a dispute about a word. For if, as
Antonius just now explained, an art is defined as
consisting in things thoroughly examined and clearly
apprehended‚ and which are also outside the control
of mere opinion, and within the grasp of exact
knowledge, then to me there seems to be no such
thing as an art of oratory. For all the kinds of
language we ourselves use in public speaking are
changeable matter, and adapted to the general

109 understanding of the crowd. If however the actual
things noticed in the practice and conduct of speaking
have been heeded and recorded by men of skill
and experience, if they have been defined in terms,
illuminated by classification, and distributed under
subdivisions—and I see that it has been possible to
do this—I do not understand why this should not be
regarded as an art, perhaps not in that precise sense
of the term, but at any rate according to the other
and popular estimate. But whether this be an art,
or only something like an art, assuredly it is not to
be disdained; we must however understand that
certain other qualifications are of greater conse-
quence for the attainment of eloquence.''
