DE ORATORE, Ι. xxiv. 110-113

XXIV. Thereupon Antonius observed that he Crassggsu

heartily agreed with Crassus, in that he was neither ξι
wedded to Art with the devotion of those for whom θ

the whole virtue of oratory resided in an art, nor on
the other hand did he put her away altogether, as
did most of the philosophers. “ But I think, Crassus,”
he continued, “ that you will be doing these two a
favour, if you will set forth those things which in your
opinion may be more profitable to oratory than even
Art herself.”

‘⁸ I will certainly name them,’' replied Crassus,
‘⁴ as Ι have once begun, beseeching you however
not to publish abroad these trifles of mine ; although
I too will restrain myself, so as not to seem a sort of
master and professional, volunteering some observa-
tions of my own, but just one of all the many Roman
citizens, a man modestly qualified through experience
of public affairs, and not altogether untrained, who
has stumbled by chance upon your discussion. The
truth is that, when in quest of an office, Ι used in
canvassing to send Scaevola away from me, explaining
to him that I proposed to be silly,⁰ that is, to make
myself winsome in my wooing, and this required
some silliness if it was to be well done, whereas our
friend here was of all men the one in whose presence
I was least willing to appear silly. Yet he it is whom
on the present occasion Fate has appointed to be an
eye-witness and observet of my silliness. For what
is sillier than to talk about talking, since talking
in itself is ever a silly business, except when it is
indispensable ? ’'

“ Proceed none the less, Crassus,'' said Mucius,

{fordiI will take upon myself that reproach you are
rea ng.
