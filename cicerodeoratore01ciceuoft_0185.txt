DE ORATORE, I. xlix. 214—1. 217

natural to his own worth and wisdom was being
claimed by yourself‚ Crassus, as the right of an
orator, he would, I do believe, instantly proceed

one who, while outstanding in some art and capacity,
has embraced another art as well, is thereby to
create the belief that such subsidiary knowledge
is a specific part of that wherein he excels, we may
