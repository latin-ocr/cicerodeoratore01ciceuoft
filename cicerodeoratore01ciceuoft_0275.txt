reading the works of these authors and a few more.

benefit: just as, when walking in the sunshine,
though perhaps taking the stroll for a different
reason, the natural result is that Ι get sunburnt,
even so, after perusing those books rather closely
at Misenum (having little chance in Rome), I find

- that under their influence my discourse takes on
what Ι may call a new complexion. However,——-not
to let you think this claim too extravagant-I under-
stand no more of Greek literature than its authors

cheated by the titles of their books, which commonly
bear headings descriptive of well-known and obvious
subjeets, such as virtue, justice, integrity or pleasure,
I do not comprehend a single word, so inextricably
are they entangled in closely reasoned and con-

an altogether different tongue, I do not attempt to
handle at all: Ι divert myself (as I said) in the
company of those who have written the story of
events, or speeches delivered by themselves, or
whose style suggests their wish to be accessible to
us men of no very profound learning. But I return
