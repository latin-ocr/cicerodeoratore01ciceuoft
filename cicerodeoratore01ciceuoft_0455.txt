cult argument or topic, occasionally I make no reply
to it at all : a method on which somebody will per-
haps justly pour ridicule—for who is there who would
not be capable of adopting it ? but all the same it is
my own capacity and not that of other people which
Ι am now discussiug, and I frankly confess that I
make it a practice, if some matter presses rather too
forcibly upon me, to retire, but in such a manner as
not to look as if I were running away even with my
shield slung behind my back, much less after throw-
ing it away, but to exhibit a certain seemliness and
dignity in my delivery, and to execute a retreat
that looks like a fight ; and when Ι come to a halt
to stand on my guard in such a manner as to appear
to have given ground for the sake of taking up a
certain position, not for the sake of escaping the
295 enemy; the other line is one which I for my part
think a speaker should only adopt with very great
caution and preparation, and which regularly causes
me an extreme amount of trouble: my practice is
not to devote my efforts to further the advancement
of my cases but to avoid doing them any damage3
not but what it is proper to use every effort in
achieving both, but it is much more damaging to a
speaker’s reputation to be deemed to have done harm
to his case than not to be thought to have advanced
it. LXXIII. But what are you whispering among
yourselves at this point, Catulus ? Do you despise
these things as they deserve to be despised ? ”
‘⁸ By no means,” he said, “ but we thought that
Caesar wanted to say something on just the point
you are treating.”
