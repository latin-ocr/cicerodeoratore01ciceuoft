DE ORATORE, Ι. xlviii. 207—209

XLVIII. ‘⁴ For my part,” answered Antonius, “ Ι Views or
see and feel myself in evident straits, not only in Δξζοθὲᾟξὸω
being questioned as to things beyond my knowledge ξε experi-
and experience, but also because this time your ⁰⁰⁰⁰·
friends do not let me shirk a situation from which
in Court Ι always do my best to run away, Ι mean
208 that of speaking next after yourself, Crassus. But
I shall the more courageously approach this under-
taking of your choice, in that Ι hope for the same
fortune in this discussion which generally befalls
my speeches, namely, that no eleganee of diction
will be expected of me. For I am not going to
speak of an art which I never learned, but of my own
practice3 and those very commonplaces, which Ι
have set down in my note-book, are no traditions
taught to me by some one or other, but such as have
been used in actual affairs and at the Bar: and if
they do not commend themselves to men of your
consummate accomplishment‚ pray blame your own
unfairness in seeking to learn of me things I did not
know ; and extol my good nature in answering you
with a good grace, won over by your enthusiasm,
not my own discretion.'’
209 “ Just go on, Antonius,” returned Crassus. “ For
there is no danger of your delivering yourself without
such practical wisdom that not a man of us will

repent of having urged you on to this discussion.”

‘⁸ Yes, I will go on,’' said the other: “ and I will
do what I think should be the first thing done in
every debate, which is that the subject for discussion
should be clearly ascertained‚ so that a discourse may
not have to ramble and lose itself, if perhaps the
disputants do not understand the issue in one and
the same sense.
