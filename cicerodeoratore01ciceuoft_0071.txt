DE ORATORE, Ι. xi. 49—xii. 52

Tbeophrastus and Carneades, on the themes which
they treated, were eloquent and displayed charm of
style and literary form, then, granting that the topics
of their discourse may be found in certain other fields
of research, yet their actual style is the peculiar pro-

as if he had got up the case for a client, will state it
better and more gracefully than the actual discoverer
