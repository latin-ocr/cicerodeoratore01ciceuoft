DE ORATORE, ΙΙ. lxxxix. 363-364

more vadmiration for your energy and industry, and‘ -

at the same time Ι rejoice in the confirmation of my
own conviction, which Ι have always held, that no
one can achieve high distinction for wisdom and
eloquence without a very great amount of zeal
and industry and study. But all the same, what
exactly did you mean by saying that we should
forgive you if we knew the motive that had led you
to deliver a discourse ? What other motive can it
be except a desire to oblige us and to satisfy the
interest of these young people, who have given you
a most attentive hearing. Ρ’

364 “‚”Oh he replied‚‘ ‘I wanted to deprive Crassus
of all excuse for crying off, having noticed a little
earlier that he was too modest, or too reluctant—for
in regard to such an agreeable person Ι will not say
too fastidious—about entering on this kind of debate.
For what will he be able to say. Ρ That he 1s a person
who has held the offices of consul and of censor ? We
can make the same plea. Or will hc adduce his age ?
He is four‘¹ years our junior. Or that he does not
know these subj ects ? Why, I took them up late and
casually and as an occupation for odd moments, as
the phrase is, whereas our friend has studied them
from boyhood with the greatest industry and under
the best masters. I will say nothing about his ability,
which nobody has ever rivalled. · in fact whereas no
one who has heard me speaking has ever held so low
an opinion of himself as not to hope he was capable of
speaking better, or at all events as well, when Crassus
speaks nobody was ever so conceited as to believe
that he would ever speak as well. Therefore, so that
these distinguished gentlemen may not have come
here to no purpose, let us at last, Crassus, hear you.’
